## Post and Answer Length


We are interested to see if there is a correlation between the length of a post and the length of answers.
Write a mapreduce program that would process the forum_node data and output the length of the post and the average answer (just answer, not comment) length for each post. You will have to decide how to write both the mapper and the reducer to get the required result.
